If youâ€™re good at music while growing up, you'll be told to become a musician, if you're good at art, an artist, and if you're good at math, a mathematician, but maybe the choice of your career should be based on more than what you enjoy or what you're good at. Let's examine this claim from a skeptic's point of view. Although the claim seems to be socially accepted, there is a strong case that could be made against it. Suppose you have two different future careers, say one career in banking and another in pandemic prevention. Suppose also that you are better and enjoy carrer banking, but if you were to work on pandemic prevention instead it would have significantly more impact, maybe saving thousands of lives, in this case is it still true that you should choose banking over pandemic prevention? Do you have an obligation to work in pandemic prevention or another equally impactful career? Is letting a thousand people die when you could have saved them morally different than killing a thousand people? The reason I ask these questions isn't to convince you about obligations or careers, but rather to demonstrate practicable, life changing moral questions. Coming out of school now there are lots of people who would see this as a moral imperative and do much more good in their lives, but those people aren't being asked these kinds  of questions in school. If we did have a moral philosophy class with these kinds of practical questions being asked, there would be a lot more people working to solve big impact problems and save millions of lives.

This is only one example of a life changing moral question which is unquestioned by society. You could ask them if they think factory farming is wrong, and if it is, is it wrong to pay for it? You could ask them if we should donate to charities, and if so how much? This isn't a moral philosophy class where they would teach all the different types of moral viewpoints, but rather a class ment to pose real life questions whose answers have an impact for the rest of their life. Adding these kinds of moral philosophy classes to schools is an easy change which can create a monstrous amount of good.
